Example: Manager A knows how to pull their Productivity results. They know how to pull up individual tech results and deep dive into their day. Manager A does not look at their results daily and when they do they have no set time in their day for reviewing their results. As a result, Manager B is not aware of the reasons why his lowest preforming techs are preforming below standard. Therefore, Manager A does not investigate the root causes of why members of his/her team did not perform to standard the previous day. Manager B’s reason for not reviewing his/her results is that he/she feels that they do not have the time in their day, most days, to go through the previous day results.
      </textarea>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <textarea>
Example:Manager A will be in the office no later than 730am to review his/her results from the previous day.
Manager A will deep dive into the days of the techs on his/her team that are the lowest performing from the previous day and the lowest performing techs month to date every day.
Manager A will have the proper discussions around his results with his team.

After reviewing manager A’s documentation, I have found that he/she does not have the proper amount of qualities and safeties in the system. Also, the qualities and safety’s entered lack proper descriptions on what they observed, and some forms have no verbiage all just checked boxes. For the qualities and safeties entered into the system with verbiage lack detail, are generally one or two sentences long and grammar mistakes are almost always present. Manager A also waits till the end of the month to enter most of their qualities and safeties for the entire month. 
      </textarea>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <textarea>
Manager A will visit at least 3 techs a day, 4 days a week. If a day is missed, then the 3 visits will be made up within that week and or within 5 working days. All make up day must be complete before the close of the month
Manager A will complete any observation without the proper verbiage and will have at least 4 full sentences.
The verbiage must clearly denote during or post observation, describe what they inspected, the condition of what they inspected and or observed, any and all corrective direction given onsite if applicable, customer interaction and feedback if applicable, what the tech was covered on while you are on site, all work done correctly, all work actions performed safely, all deviations, safety violations and all relevant information that adds to the full understanding of what you observed while on site.

Manager A gets to work close to the time of his/her team’s start time. Get to work so close to the start of his/her team’s shift leave him/her little to no time to plan for the day. Also Manager B does not have any schedule planning in place so there is no order in their day or to their day. Manager A also does not know how to prioritize things in their day so often less important things get done while more important things remain un-started or unfinished.  
    </textarea><br>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <textarea>
Trained Manager A how to set reminders, move reminders and delete reminders.
Before the close of work Manager A will utilize his/her Outlook Calendar to set reminders for the following day.
Manager A will be in the office no later than 730am.
Manager A will follow the schedule on in their Outlook Calendar and if something happens and it throws off his/her time table Manager A will prioritize what needs to be done that day and what can be moved if necessary to the following day.
Manager A needs help in prioritizing his/her schedule they will reach out to me.

ATO Coach: Do you have any questions about what we covered today or the targets we set together?
Mgr A: Yes, what happens if I go on vacation or get sick?
ATO Coach: If there is a reason outside of your control that prevents you from meeting the above stated targets we will talk with your Area Manager about amending the target, great question.
ATO Coach: Do you have any other questions about what we covered today or the targets we set together?
Mgr A: What if I need help and you are out on vacation our out of the office, who do I go to?
ATO Coach: I will make you aware when I go out on vacation or if I am unavailable which Coach you can contact in my absence. Another great question. 
ATO Coach: Do you have any other questions about what we covered today or the targets we set together?
Mrg A: Yes, my last question is what if I don’t meet the target, but I get really close, do I get in trouble?
ATO Coach: The purpose of our meeting is to help improve your performance, record your progress, and provide the same feedback to you and your Area Manager. This is the extent of my role. Any questions you have about any possible actions outside of the extent of my role you need to be ask of your Area Manager. 
Mgr A: What if I can’t meet most of the targets because it turns out they are too high, but I make improvement?
ATO Coach: If later there is a concern that the target we set are too high we can ask your Area Manager if they can be adjusted. All changes to any plan require your Area Manager’s approval before any adjustment can be made. Do you think the targets we set are to high?
Mgr A: No, but I don’t know. I am afraid that I won’t make all the targets
ATO Coach: I will do all that I can to help you meet your targets and we will work together towards your success. I have complete faith in you and in your ability to meet and even exceed your goals. Thank you for your questions, they are great questions. Do you have any other questions?
Mgr A: No not right now
ATO Coach: Okay, thank you for meeting with me today. I really look forward to work with you and seeing you succeed.
